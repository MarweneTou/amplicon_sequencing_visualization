# amplicon_sequencing_visualization
This application is used in order to process the data obtained using the Mothur software for amplicon sequencing
Among the files generated by mothur, two important files are created, one contain the OTUs taxonomy and the other contains there abundance within the samples.
These two files are not processed and separated. The amplicon_sequencing_visualization application aims to comcatenate and process both files, also showing fast graphs (heatmap, barplot and pca)
