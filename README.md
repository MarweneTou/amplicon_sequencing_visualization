# amplicon_sequencing_visualization
This application is used in order to process the data obtained using the Mothur software for amplicon sequencing
Among the files generated by mothur, two important files are created, the first contains the OTUs taxonomy and the second contains the OTUs abundance within the samples.
These two files are separated and not processed. The amplicon_sequencing_visualization application aims to comcatenate and process both files, also to create graphs in few clicks (heatmap, barplot and pca)
